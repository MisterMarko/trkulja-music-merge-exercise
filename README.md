# Documentation

After doing tasks 1-3, both main branch and a-feature branch have their own history. On both we added a file and wrote some lines into them. For now they are seperate and both have 3
 commits. 

After repeating the process (adding mroe lines to onMain.md,multiple times), the main branch has many commits and the content consists of readme.md and onMain.md. 
In contrast, a -feature branch still has only a few commits and the content there is only onBranch.md. They are still separate branches. 

We merge a-feature branch into main branch. After merging, main branch now has all the commits from both branches and the content consists of readme.md, onMain.md and onBranch.md.
